			Hi, I'm Ally (Aika) Kline. I'm currently a junior at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California. I really enjoy working with technology and computers. My talents include, but are not limited to: pro binge watching, tea drinking and enjoying, lip synching (especially in the shower), taking <i>very</i> artsy pictures, and rolling my R's. I participated in the Girls Who Code 2016 Summer Immersion Program, where I learned Python, Arduino Robotics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time, I like to chill with my dog, Stewie, play video games, draw, and write. I would like to study CS in college and <i>hopefully</i> get to work in video/computer game design and creation in the future.

			Hey pals! :-) My name is Paola Alban, I'm 17 years old and I am currently an incoming senior at Middle College high school in San Pablo, CA. I came here from Peru when I was about 4 years old, and have been a bay area native ever since. My hobbies mostly consist of hiking, dancing, netflix, and hanging out with friends/family. I really enjoy spending time with loved ones especially my two dogs, Oso and Pinky. Pinky can be kind of rude when you first meet her but she'll warm up eventually. Oso is the love of my life.
