	  <h1 class ="sectiontitle">What is Planty .. ?</h1>
	  	
	  <h3 class ="text"> Planty is a mobile web app designed by amazing programmers: Ally Kline, Paola Alban, Sara Zamora, and Allison Sugabo. This program was made possible with the help of Hanah Yendler. It is designed for people who don't seem to know much about vicious plants that may be creeping on them in their surroundings. Have any of you gone hiking, camping, or maybe just on a walk down the street and seen beautiful plants but not known if they were safe to touch? Well, best believe there's a lot more people like you out there!! Don't be ashamed and use planty! Planty helps you differentiate dangerous, harmful plants from curious, gorgeous plants. :-) </h3>

	  <h1 class="sectiontitle"> WATSON </h1>

	  <h3 class="text"> To make this tool possible we used the help of Watson. Watson is a computer system that's used to answer questions. In this case we used Watson's Visual Recognition feature to identify the types of plants. This allows you and our users to identify plants through our amazing mobile web app. Enjoy! </h3>
